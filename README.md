### `Who are using Markdown?`

Most of developers and even non-developers are using Markdown to explain their project or to record something important in their digital note since they are pretty easy to learn.

### `Why did i make this project?`

As i wanted to explain my project with well organized documentation, i felt i needed to learn Markdown language. Also thought that it's gonna be great if i deploy this app and let people learn it sice it's widely used and pretty easy to learn compared to other languages.
